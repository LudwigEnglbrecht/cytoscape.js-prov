# cytoscape.js-prov_nodejs: W3C-Prov to Cytoscape network (native)

This extension transforms W3C-Prov (generated by [camflow](http://camflow.org/) to a Cytoscape network (JSON) using cytoscape.js-prov and NodeJS. 

## Architecture
Within the scope of this implementation, a program was created, which integrated the prototype cytoscape.js-prov into a Node.js environment. The following figure illustrates how provenance data is transformed to a cytoscape network using (cytoscape.js-prov).

To achieve this the structure of the source code was analyzed and the important functionalities for the integrated application. Thereby it was possible to select the functionalities important for the integrated design from the source code into the new program. Since a large part of the code of the prototype was used for the visualization of the provenance graphs, the program code could be shortened and made clearer. A visual representation is not provided in this version.

## Usage
```
node integration.js
```

# Used in the following research projects

- Digital Forensics Analysis 


# Next steps

* Add "CamFlow/cytoscape.js-prov" as a sub-module to benefit from further developments
* Add Message Broker for sending provenance data to the MongoDB
* Address performance issues during the network parsing in node.js

# About the project

This project deals with purpose-specific extensions of existing data-provenance software and was developed as part of a bachelor thesis at the University of Regensburg, Chair of Information Systems (Prof. Dr. GÃ¼nther Pernul), [(https://www.uni-regensburg.de/wirtschaftswissenschaften/wi-pernul/)](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/wirtschaftswissenschaften/wi-pernul/) under the supervision of [Mr. Ludwig Englbrecht](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ludwig_Englbrecht) during his Ph.D. Research Project. The software is intended for educational and academic use.
